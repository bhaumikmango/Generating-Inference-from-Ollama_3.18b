      "Based on the provided data, I'll perform the analyses as requested. However, please note that without actual customer data (Age, Total Purchases, Account Manager, Number of Years with Company, Number of Sites), we can't train a model directly. Instead, I'll provide a general outline and recommendations based on industry best practices.\n",

      "\t* Decision Trees\n",
      "\t* Random Forests\n",

      "2. **Improve Account Manager relationships:** Train account managers to understand individual customer needs and preferences. This can lead to stronger relationships and increased loyalty.\n",
      "3. **Offer personalized promotions:** Use data analysis to identify customers who are more likely to respond to specific promotions or discounts. Targeted marketing campaigns can help keep these customers engaged.\n",
      "4. **Enhance the customer experience:** Focus on improving overall satisfaction through better service, faster issue resolution, and regular feedback opportunities.\n",
      "5. **Monitor and adjust:** Continuously monitor churn rates and adjust strategies as needed based on changes in market conditions, customer behavior, or other factors.\n",

      "Some potential patterns observed from the analysis might include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Younger customers (e.g., under 30) with fewer years of service are more likely to churn\n",
      "* Customers who have made only a few purchases within a short period are at higher risk of churning\n",
      "* Those with an inactive account manager or poor relationship may be more likely to leave\n",
